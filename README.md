## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application can be configured using the following variables:

- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `development` for debug mode
- `SECRET_KEY`: Application secret key (auto-generated)
- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: Directory for file uploads (default: `patient-referral/`)
- `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`: Maximum file upload size (default: 16MB)

### Database Configuration

The application uses SQLite by default. The database schema includes:

- **Users** table for authentication
- **Referrals** table for patient referrals
- **Documents** table for file management

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:

1. **Use a production WSGI server** (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI)
2. **Configure a reverse proxy** (e.g., Nginx, Apache)
3. **Use a production database** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
4. **Set up SSL/TLS encryption**
5. **Configure environment variables**
6. **Set up backup and monitoring**

### Docker Deployment

A Dockerfile can be created for containerized deployment:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **User Registration & Login**
   - Test account creation with different roles
   - Verify password validation and security

2. **Referral Management**
   - Create referrals with various urgency levels
   - Test QR code generation and display

3. **File Upload**
   - Upload different file types and sizes
   - Test document categorization

4. **Dashboard Functionality**
   - Verify statistics accuracy
   - Test responsive design on mobile devices

### Automated Testing

Future enhancements could include:
- Unit tests with pytest
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Frontend tests with Selenium
- Performance testing with locust

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures

- **Password Hashing**: Using Werkzeug's secure password hashing
- **File Upload Validation**: Restricted file types and size limits
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Template escaping and input sanitization
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with Flask

### Additional Security Recommendations

- Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- Add two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- HTTPS enforcement in production

## 🎨 Customization

### Themes and Styling

The application uses a modular CSS approach:

- **Custom CSS**: Located in `static/css/style.css`
- **Bootstrap Variables**: Can be customized for branding
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints

#### Visual Design Guidelines

The overall look and feel should convey professionalism while remaining friendly
and approachable:

- **Use authentic imagery** such as photos of real dental professionals or
  patients (with consent) to build trust. High-quality 3D graphics can also be
  effective.
- **Color scheme** should lean toward calming medical greens and avoid overly
  cartoonish palettes.
- **Modern illustrations only**; avoid outdated clip-art that makes the product
  appear less sophisticated.
- **Clean layouts with ample whitespace** keep the interface focused and easy to
  navigate.


### Feature Extensions

The system is designed for extensibility:

- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for mobile app integration
- **Notification System**: Email and SMS notifications
- **Reporting**: Advanced analytics and reporting features
- **Integration**: Connect with EMR/EHR systems
- **Multi-language**: Internationalization support

## NoCodeBackend Integration

This project integrates two NoCodeBackend database instances to store referrals and website uploads.

### Setup

1. Ensure you have environment variables configured in your `.env` file or deployment environment:

```
NOCODEBACKEND_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>
NOCODEBACKEND_REFERRAL_INSTANCE=35557_referralomsdb
NOCODEBACKEND_UPLOADS_INSTANCE=35557_website_uploads
```

The secret key must **never** be committed to version control. Set it via GitHub repository secrets or your deployment platform's environment configuration.

2. Install the Python dependencies (if running locally) and ensure `requests` is available.

### Usage

A helper module `nocodebackend_client.py` encapsulates interactions with the NoCodeBackend API. It uses the environment variables above to authenticate and send requests.

Example usage:

```python
from nocodebackend_client import NoCodeBackendClient

client = NoCodeBackendClient()

# Create a referral record
referral_data = {
    "patient_name": "John Doe",
    "contact": "john@example.com",
    "procedure_type": "implant",
    "notes": "Example referral"
}
client.create_referral(referral_data)

# Create a website upload record
upload_data = {
    "file_name": "report.pdf",
    "category": "Reports",
    "notes": "Initial consultation report"
}
client.create_upload(upload_data)
```

The application also exposes an example Flask route at `/api/nocodebackend/referrals` which demonstrates how to create a referral via an HTTP POST request. You can extend this to handle uploads or other operations.

For more details on the API endpoints, refer to the NoCodeBackend documentation for the relevant instances:

- Referral database: https://api.nocodebackend.com/api-docs/?Instance=35557_referralomsdb
- Website uploads database: https://api.nocodebackend.com/api-docs/?Instance=35557_website_uploads
- Sapyyn referral database (sapyynreferral_db): https://api.nocodebackend.com/api-docs/?Instance=35557_sapyynreferral_db
