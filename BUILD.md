# Sapyyn Platform - Build Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary
The build was failing due to incompatible Python dependencies:
- `gevent==23.9.1` incompatible with Python 3.13.5
- Cython compilation errors with `gevent` and `long` type
- Legacy Flask dependencies causing conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Dependencies
Created `requirements-build.txt` with compatible versions:
- **Flask**: 2.3.3 → 3.0.0 (latest stable)
- **Werkzeug**: 2.3.7 → 3.0.1 (latest stable)
- **gevent**: 23.9.1 → 24.2.1 (Python 3.13 compatible)
- **Pillow**: Fixed at 11.0.0 (latest stable)

### 2. Build Configuration
- **netlify.toml**: Updated build configuration
- **runtime.txt**: Specifies Python 3.11 (stable)
- **netlify-build.sh**: Custom build script with error handling

### 3. Files Created/Updated

#### `requirements-build.txt`
Complete dependency list with Python 3.13+ compatibility:
- Flask ecosystem updated to latest versions
- gevent updated to 24.2.1 (fixes Cython issues)
- All dependencies tested for compatibility

#### `netlify.toml`
Netlify configuration:
- Uses Python 3.11 (stable)
- Custom build command: `./netlify-build.sh`
- Security headers configured
- Static asset caching optimized

#### `netlify-build.sh`
Custom build script:
- Environment cleanup
- Pip upgrade
- Dependency installation
- Installation verification
- Static asset handling

#### `runtime.txt`
Specifies Python 3.11 for Netlify builds

## Build Process

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test build locally
chmod +x netlify-build.sh
./netlify-build.sh
```

### Netlify Deployment
1. Push changes to repository
2. Netlify will automatically use the new configuration
3. Build should complete successfully

## Verification Steps
After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] All dependencies install correctly
- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] Static assets are served correctly

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check Netlify build logs for specific errors
2. Verify Python version in runtime.txt
3. Check for any cached dependencies in Netlify
4. Ensure all files are committed to git

## Dependencies Summary
| Package | Old Version | New Version | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Flask | 2.3.3 | 3.0.0 | Latest stable |
| Werkzeug | 2.3.7 | 3.0.1 | Latest stable |
| gevent | 23.9.1 | 24.2.1 | Python 3.13 compatible |
| Pillow | 11.0.0 | 11.0.0 | Latest stable |
| greenlet | - | 3.0.3 | gevent dependency |

## Build Command
The new build command is:
```bash
./netlify-build.sh
```

This replaces the previous custom build command that was causing issues.
