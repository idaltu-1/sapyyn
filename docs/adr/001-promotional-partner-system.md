# ADR 001: Promotional-Partner / Ad-Space Module

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Sapyyn Patient Referral System needs a way for dental practices to monetize their portal by displaying sponsored content from partners. This feature must be implemented in a way that maintains HIPAA compliance and protects patient data while providing value to both practices and their partners.

## Decision

We will implement a Promotional-Partner / Ad-Space Module with the following key architectural decisions:

1. **Database Schema**:
   - Create separate tables for promotions, promotion roles, and user preferences
   - Store tracking data (impressions, clicks) directly in the promotion record
   - Implement a comprehensive audit trail for all promotion-related actions

2. **Promotion Selection**:
   - Use a weighted round-robin algorithm based on impression count
   - Filter promotions by user role, location, and date range
   - Respect user opt-out preferences

3. **HIPAA Compliance**:
   - Implement URL sanitization to remove sensitive parameters from redirect URLs
   - Use isolated transactions for tracking to avoid any connection to PHI
   - Provide clear "Sponsored" labeling for all promotional content
   - Create comprehensive audit logging for all actions

4. **User Experience**:
   - Allow users to opt out of targeted promotions
   - Design responsive promotion slots for different placement locations
   - Ensure promotions don't interfere with core functionality

5. **Admin Interface**:
   - Create a comprehensive admin interface for managing promotions
   - Provide performance metrics and analytics
   - Implement role-based targeting

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **New Revenue Stream**: Practices can generate additional revenue through partner advertisements
2. **Targeted Content**: Users see relevant promotional content based on their role
3. **HIPAA Compliance**: The implementation ensures no PHI is shared with partners
4. **User Control**: Users can opt out of targeted promotions
5. **Performance Tracking**: Administrators can track promotion performance
6. **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged for compliance purposes

### Negative

1. **Increased Complexity**: The system becomes more complex with additional tables and logic
2. **Performance Impact**: Additional database queries for promotion selection
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: More code to maintain and test
4. **User Experience Concerns**: Promotions could potentially distract from core functionality
5. **Compliance Risk**: Requires careful implementation to maintain HIPAA compliance

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Third-Party Ad Network

**Pros**:
- Easier implementation
- Established tracking and analytics
- Potentially higher revenue

**Cons**:
- Less control over content
- Higher risk of HIPAA violations
- Potential for inappropriate ads
- Revenue sharing with the ad network

### 2. Subscription-Only Model

**Pros**:
- Simpler implementation
- No compliance concerns related to advertising
- Cleaner user interface

**Cons**:
- Limited revenue potential
- Higher barrier to entry for practices
- Less flexibility in monetization strategy

### 3. Affiliate Links Only

**Pros**:
- Simpler implementation
- Less intrusive for users
- Lower compliance risk

**Cons**:
- Limited revenue potential
- Less visibility for partners
- Harder to track performance

## Implementation Notes

1. **Phased Approach**:
   - Phase 1: Basic promotion display and tracking
   - Phase 2: Role-based targeting and user preferences
   - Phase 3: Advanced analytics and optimization

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for the full workflow
   - Specific tests for HIPAA compliance measures

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Track impression and click counts
   - Monitor performance impact
   - Audit log analysis

## Future Considerations

1. **A/B Testing**: Implement A/B testing for promotion effectiveness
2. **Machine Learning**: Use ML to optimize promotion selection
3. **Partner Portal**: Create a self-service portal for partners
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Provide more detailed performance metrics
5. **Integration with External Ad Networks**: Consider integration with compliant healthcare ad networks
