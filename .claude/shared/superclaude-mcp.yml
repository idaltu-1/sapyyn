Context7:
  Purpose: "Official library documentation & code examples | Research standards"
  Capabilities: "resolve-library-id | get-library-docs | version-specific documentation"
  Best_For: "API integration | Framework patterns | Library adoption | Official standards"
  Use: "Research-first methodology | Evidence-based implementation"
  Token_Cost: "Low-Medium | High accuracy | Authoritative sources"
  Workflows: "Library detection → resolve-id → get-docs → implement with citations"

Sequential:
  Purpose: "Multi-step complex problem solving | Architectural thinking | Analysis"
  Capabilities: "sequentialthinking | adaptive reasoning | systematic problem decomposition"
  Best_For: "System design | Root cause analysis | Complex debugging | Architecture review"
  Use: "Deep technical analysis | Evidence-based reasoning | Quality investigation"
  Token_Cost: "Medium-High | Comprehensive analysis | Insights"
  Workflows: "Problem → decompose → analyze → synthesize → recommend"

Magic:
  Purpose: "UI component generation | Design system integration"
  Capabilities: "component-builder | component-refiner | component-inspiration | logo-search"
  Best_For: "React/Vue components | Design systems | UI patterns | Rapid prototyping"
  Use: "Consistent design implementation | Pattern adherence | Quality components"
  Token_Cost: "Medium | High-quality output | Design system compliance"
  Workflows: "Requirements → generate → refine → integrate → validate"

Puppeteer:
